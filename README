scons-tidbits
=============

Share the scons tidbits I have developed.

You are welcome to copy, give to your friends, and tell everybody to
do so.  Just be honest and do not take credit for it.  That is all.

Currently, the SConstruct and SConscript pair demonstrates two usages
of scons:

1. Record the time stamp of a successful build, including a build that did
nothing because everything is current.

2. Build a "lint" variant.  The lint program I use, Google's
cpplint.py, lints files named as .h, .cpp or .cc.  I have to rename
non-conforming files to fool the lint program.

I'm far from being a scons expert and welcome any suggestions for
improvements.
